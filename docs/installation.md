<h1 align="center">Installing ClamAV GUI</h1>

**ArsenTech's ClamAV GUI version 1.0.3** is a minimal, open-source interface for file scanning and threat detection that makes the Antivirus itself look professional and work exactly like ClamAV (A FOSS CLI Antivirus).

This software is provided as-is. No data is collected or transmitted. This GUI uses ClamAV's `clamscan` and `freshclam` engines. Scan types are presets that define which locations and which limits are used.

ClamAV is a trademark of Cisco Systems, Inc. This project is an independent, open-source GUI and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Cisco.

### Pre-installation requirements
### Hardware
- Processor:
    - AMD Ryzen, Threadripper, or Epyc
    - Intel Core (9th generation and newer) i3, i5, i7, i9, Ultra or equivalent Xeon
    - Apple Silicon M1 and newer
- Minimum System Memory: **16 GB** for the ClamAV GUI app
- System storage: ~15MB for the ClamAV GUI app
- Display resolution: 1280x960 minimum, proportionately higher with display scaling.

### Software
- **Windows 10+ / Linux / macOS**
- [**ClamAV Engine**](https://www.clamav.net/) to make the ClamAV GUI work

## Downloading the GUI
Download the latest version of ClamAV GUI from the Repo's Releases section
### Windows
Launch a Command Prompt Window and use the `certutil` command to verify the download:
```cmd
cd Downloads

```
> [!Tip]
> Alternatively, you may use free third-party apps 7-Zip Compute Hash, ExactFile, and MultiHasher for a GUI-based checksum

![finish](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArsenTech/clamav-gui/refs/heads/main/.github/docs-images/installation/finish.png)

Next, the installer will ask you where you wish to install the GUI. Unless you have a specific reason to change this setting, select `Next` to install the GUI with these initial settings. Once it's complete, select `Finish` to exit the installer.

## Launching the GUI
